      <Center><h2><mark>VACCINATION</mark></h2></Center>
      <p>COVID-19 vaccinations have played a pivotal role in combating the global pandemic. 
        Multiple vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, 
        have been developed and authorized for use. These vaccines have proven effective in preventing severe 
        illness and reducing virus transmission. Vaccination campaigns prioritize high-risk groups, and booster
         doses may be recommended over time. Common side effects, including mild symptoms like soreness and
          fatigue, are generally short-lived. Global access challenges persist, with efforts ongoing to address
           disparities. Vaccination certificates may be implemented for travel and access verification.
         Stay informed and follow local health guidelines for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

      <Center><h2><mark>MASK</mark></h2></Center>
      <p>Wearing masks is really important in the fight against COVID-19.
         Masks act as a barrier, stopping respiratory droplets that may carry the virus from spreading to others. 
         They also provide some protection to the person wearing the mask. When more people wear masks, 
         it helps protect the whole community by reducing the overall transmission of the virus. 
         Masks work best when used along with other measures like keeping a safe distance from others and 
         washing hands. They are especially crucial in crowded places and places where the risk of spreading 
         the virus is higher. Wearing masks is a responsible and caring action, helping to keep everyone safe, especially those who might get seriously ill from the virus. 
        It's a simple but effective way to slow down the spread of COVID-19, even from people who may not feel sick.</p>
